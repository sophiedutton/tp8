      <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place a serving platter into the oven to warm.</li>
      <li>Season the chicken breast pieces with salt and pepper and dredge them in flour.</li>
      <li>Shake off excess flour. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet; pan-fry the chicken pieces until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
      <li>Work in batches and do not crowd skillet, adding oil as needed . Place the chicken pieces onto the warmed platter in the oven.</li>

      <li>Cook and stir the minced garlic in the skillet until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Pour in the chicken broth.</li>
      <li>Scrape and dissolve any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in the lemon slices and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
      <li>Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces to about 2/3 cup, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the lemon juice and capers; simmer until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Drop the butter into the skillet and swirl it into the sauce by tilting the skillet until the butter is melted and incorporated.</li>
      <li>Add the parsley; remove from heat and set aside.</li>
