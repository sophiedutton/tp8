  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut pressed tofu into 1/2-inch thick slices; then cut again into 1/2-inch wide sticks.
      Place tofu in a bowl, and pour broth over the top. Set aside to soak.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, stir together flour, yeast, salt, pepper, sage, and cayenne.</li>
    <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Remove tofu sticks from broth, and squeeze most <span>(but not all)</span> of the liquid from them.
      Roll sticks in breading. <span>(You may have to roll sticks twice to end up with a fairly dry outer layer of breading.)</span>
      Place tofu in hot oil; fry until crisp and browned on all sides. Add more oil if necessary.</li>
